# The base forms the structure of your pizza. You can choose from ready-made pizza bases or can make one at home. Make sure that you knead the dough properly and pay close attention to the ingredients that you add. A little yeast is always desirable as it helps the base to rise properly. Adding lukewarm water and a little olive oil ensures a wonderfully smooth and soft dough. You can choose from a variety of flours for your base. From the traditional refined flour (maida) to whole wheat flour, multi-grain, soy flour and oatmeal flour, it's the rising demand for healthy alternatives that has made a variety of pizza bases popular - the newest and the hottest addition is the quinoa pizza base.
